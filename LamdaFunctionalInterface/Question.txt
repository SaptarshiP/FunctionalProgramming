The difference between lamda expression and anonymous class:
1. The anounymous class is a class which doesn't have any name beside that lamda expression is a method without a name.
2. The anounymous class can extend abstract class  and lamda expression cannot extend the abstract class.
3. Within anounymous class we can provide defination for more than one method, in lamda expression we can implement a single abstract method of functional interface.
4. Anounymous class can have instance variable, in lamda expression it doesnot have any instance variable it works as a single method which have local variable.
5. The 'this' keyword within anounymous class can represent to the anonymous class instead in lamda expression 'this' keyword refer to the parent class.
6. The anounymous class create a new .class file and lamda expression get compiled with the method the class which is holding it.
7. Anounymous class can be instantiated but lamda expression can't be instantiated.
